# sorting-mini-project
Wenfei Lin

As the name suggests, it's our mini-project for the sorting lab. Each file implements the sorting algorithm suggested in its name, and LinWenfeiSort.java is my attempt at creating a relatively fast sorting algorithm for the sorting competition.

InsertionSort was completed with reference to code from the lab that was created by me and Reed. 

MergeSort was completed with reference to code form the lab that was created by me and Albert. 

QuickSort was done with the help of SamR's demonstration in class.

LinWenfeiSort uses the basis of TimSort with the help of ChatGPT to help modify and optimize it. ChatGPT was useful in writing a simplified version of TimSort and explaining what could be better optimized about it, which I then used as further prompts for ChatGPT to help further optimize the TimSort algorithm it originally gave me. I only tweaked a few things regarding the variable inputs and formatting of the code (in terms of method declarations and such) to better suit the framework provided by this mini project.
