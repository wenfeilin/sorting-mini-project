# sorting-mini-project
Wenfei Lin<br>
As the name suggests, it's our mini-project for the sorting lab. Each file implements the sorting algorithm suggested in its name, and LinWenfeiSort.java is my attempt at creating a relatively fast sorting algorithm for the sorting competition.

InsertionSort was completed with reference to code from the lab that was created by me and Reed. <br>
MergeSort was completed with reference to code form the lab that was created by me and Albert. <br>
QuickSort was done with the help of SamR's demonstration in class.<br>
LinWenfeiSort uses the basis of TimSort with the help of ChatGPT to help modify and optimize it. ChatGPT was useful in writing a simplified version of TimSort and explaining what could be better optimized about it, which I then used as further prompts for ChatGPT to help further optimize the TimSort algorithm it originally gave me. I only tweaked a few things regarding the variable inputs and formatting of the code (in terms of method declarations and such) to better suit the framework provided by this mini project.
